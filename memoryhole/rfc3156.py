class MultipartSigned(MIMEMultipart):
    """
    Multipart/Signed MIME message according to RFC 1847.

    2.1. Definition of Multipart/Signed

      (1)  MIME type name: multipart
      (2)  MIME subtype name: signed
      (3)  Required parameters: boundary, protocol, and micalg
      (4)  Optional parameters: none
      (5)  Security considerations: Must be treated as opaque while in
           transit

    The multipart/signed content type contains exactly two body parts.
    The first body part is the body part over which the digital signature
    was created, including its MIME headers.  The second body part
    contains the control information necessary to verify the digital
    signature.  The first body part may contain any valid MIME content
    type, labeled accordingly.  The second body part is labeled according
    to the value of the protocol parameter.

    When the OpenPGP digital signature is generated:

    (1)   The data to be signed MUST first be converted to its content-
          type specific canonical form.  For text/plain, this means
          conversion to an appropriate character set and conversion of
          line endings to the canonical <CR><LF> sequence.

    (2)   An appropriate Content-Transfer-Encoding is then applied; see
          section 3.  In particular, line endings in the encoded data
          MUST use the canonical <CR><LF> sequence where appropriate
          (note that the canonical line ending may or may not be present
          on the last line of encoded data and MUST NOT be included in
          the signature if absent).

    (3)   MIME content headers are then added to the body, each ending
          with the canonical <CR><LF> sequence.

    (4)   As described in section 3 of this document, any trailing
          whitespace MUST then be removed from the signed material.

    (5)   As described in [2], the digital signature MUST be calculated
          over both the data to be signed and its set of content headers.

    (6)   The signature MUST be generated detached from the signed data
          so that the process does not alter the signed data in any way.
